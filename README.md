## Deployment

### Current Deployment

The website is currently available at:

- [GitPages](https://patrickpulfer.github.io/codeinsitute_usercentric_milestone_project/index.html)

I have used the following method to deploy this website at GitPages but may also use this workflow to deploy any websites at GitPages:

1. Navigate to your GitHub Project
2. On the top of your project files, there is a menu bar. Click on "Settings"
3. In your settings view, scroll down until the section "GitHub Pages"
4. Here you can chose the Source (preferentially main branch) and Save to deploy
5. Note the URL at "Your site is published at XXXXXX". This will be the URL to share

### Further Deployment

You may deploy this website on your local machine for testing purposes.

On **_Linux_**, you can easilly do this on your terminal if you have git installed:

```
cd <to your prefered folder>
git clone https://github.com/patrickpulfer/codeinsitute_usercentric_milestone_project.git

```

To run, simply double click the index.html file in the target folder or run the following command:

```
xdg-open ./codeinsitute_usercentric_milestone_project/index.html
```

Downloading the source code as Zip file from GitHub is also a valid method for **_Linux_** and **_Windows_**. On the project page, look for the Code button with arrow down as shown below:

Note: You will have the extract the contents of your .zip file with your OS's decompression tool. [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) is a good alternative.

Once unzipped, look for the index.html file and double click it.
