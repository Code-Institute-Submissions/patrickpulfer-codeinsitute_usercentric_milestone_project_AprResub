# Wireframes for PaddyOS Website

## Basic Layout & Principles

User Interface should be simple and focused on content, so I will leave areas untouched to avoid distractions.

Website will be Mobile & Tablet friendly. Bootstrap will help us achieve the basic grid but adjustments with CSS will be required.

### Goal
* Draw user attention to the middle of the screen, particularly:
    * Branding (Logo & Name)
    * Slogan
    * "Learn More" & "Download" buttons

### Desktop
* Basic Navigation Bar with Logo, links to different sections and social media icons


### Mobile
* Majority of users are right handed, so we will move the menu "Burger" to the right

## Decluttering Mobile view

### Goal
* Remove unecessary pictures in mobile view to ensure page does not have too much content
* Shuffle Bootstrap Grid to ensure a consistent look

## Download Section

### Goal
* Emphasis on Release download as opposed to to Developer Edition
* Registration for developers should occur in a modal, so it is hidden unless requested

## Contact Us & Thank You section

### Goal
* Thank the user for sending a message or submitting developer registration form
* Navigate the user back from thank you page to main page
